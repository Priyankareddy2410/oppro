Project Synopsis: FallGuard - Identifying Patients at Risk of Falling
Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Framework: Scikit-learn, Flask (for web application)
Natural Language Processing (NLP): spaCy
Web Development: Flask
Containerization: Docker

Project Flow:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Dataset: Utilize a dataset containing patient information and clinical notes (e.g., data/your_dataset.csv).
Data Processing: Extract, clean, and preprocess clinical notes using spaCy (src/data_processing.py).

Machine Learning Model Training:
Model: Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for fall risk assessment using Scikit-learn (src/model_training.py).
Vectorization: Implement TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.

Fall Risk Assessment:
Module: Develop a module (src/fall_risk_assessment.py) for assessing fall risk based on user queries.
Integration: Integrate the model and assessment module into a Flask web application (src/app.py).

User Interaction:
Dialogflow Integration: Use Flask to create an API endpoint (/webhook) for handling user queries from Dialogflow.
Conversational Interface: Engage users in a conversational manner, providing fall risk assessments.

Deployment :
Containerization: Utilize Docker for containerization to ensure consistency and portability.
Web Application Deployment: Deploy the Flask web application on cloud platforms for accessibility.

Testing and Evaluation:
User Testing: Manually test the interaction with the Dialogflow agent and the fall risk assessment system.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using relevant metrics.

Documentation :
GitHub Repository: Maintain a well-documented GitHub repository with clear instructions for setup and usage.


Objectives and Goals:

Enhance Patient Safety:
Objective: Develop a system to identify patients at risk of falling.
Goal: Reduce the incidence of falls and fall-related injuries, ultimately improving patient safety.

Cost Savings and Resource Allocation:
Objective: Implement a system that contributes to cost savings and better resource allocation in healthcare.
Goal: Reduce complications, shorten hospital stays, and optimize resource allocation.

User-Friendly Interaction:
Objective: Create a user-friendly conversational interface.
Goal: Engage users in a natural conversation for fall risk assessments, enhancing the overall user experience.

Continuous Improvement and Collaboration:
Objective: Establish an ongoing feedback loop with healthcare professionals.
Goal: Iteratively improve the model and system based on real-world insights and user feedback.

Scalability and Deployment :
Objective: Ensure scalability for handling larger datasets and user loads.
Goal: Optionally deploy the system on cloud platforms for broader accessibility.

Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- data/: Contains the dataset (`your_dataset.csv`).
- src/: Source code for the project.
  - data_processing.py: Module for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
  - model_training.py: Module for training the fall risk assessment model.
  - fall_risk_assessment.py: Module for using the trained model to assess fall risk.
  - app.py: Flask app for interacting with the fall risk assessment system.
- venv/: Virtual environment for dependencies.
- requirements.txt: List of Python packages required for the project.
- Dockerfile: Configuration for Docker containerization.



Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    virtualenv venv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Usage
Run the Flask app:
```bash
python src/app.py
